Auto Third Person but it's for fabric 1.16
==========================================

Puts you in third person when you do certain things.

## A note on dependencies and config

This mod uses Cloth Config for its config screen, but for filesize reasons, doesn't bundle it. If you have both ModMenu and Cloth Config (and in a big enough modpack, you probably do), a config screen is available from ModMenu.

The mod can always be configured through its config file. Reload resources (F3+T) to reread the file.
